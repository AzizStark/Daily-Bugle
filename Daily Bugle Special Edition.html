                        A massive explosion ripped through Oscorp Industries' research facility 
                        late last night, sending shockwaves across Manhattan and leaving at least 
                        47 people injured. The blast, which occurred at approximately 11:47 PM, 
                        destroyed three floors of the company's headquarters and could be felt 
                        as far away as Brooklyn.

                        47th floors of the iconic Oscorp Tower. Firefighters battled the blaze for 
                        over four hours before bringing it under control. The building has been 
                        evacuated and declared structurally unstable.

                    <p class="article-text">
                        While officials have not yet determined the cause of the explosion, sources 
                        close to the investigation suggest it originated in Oscorp's controversial 
                        genetic research division. The company has faced scrutiny in recent months 
                        over safety protocols in its experimental laboratories.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        CEO Norman Osborn, who was not in the building at the time of the blast, 
                        released a statement early this morning: "We are devastated by this tragedy. 
                        Our thoughts are with the injured and their families. We are cooperating 
                        fully with investigators to determine what happened."
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        However, critics are demanding answers. City Councilwoman Patricia Hayes 
                        has called for an immediate investigation into Oscorp's safety record. 
                        "This company has been operating with minimal oversight for too long," 
                        Hayes stated. "The people of New York deserve to know what dangerous 
                        experiments were being conducted in the heart of our city."

                        Multiple witnesses report that the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man 
                        was among the first responders at the scene, pulling victims from the 
                        burning building before firefighters arrived. While some hail his actions 
                        as heroic, others question what he might have been doing at Oscorp at 
                        that hour.

                        "He was swinging people down from the upper floors," said witness David 
                        Park. "Without him, I don't think everyone would have made it out."

                        Mayor Wilson declared a state of emergency for the affected area and

                        remain evacuated as structural engineers assess potential damage from 
                        the blast.

                        This is not the first incident at Oscorp facilities. In 2019, a chemical 
                        spill resulted in a temporary shutdown of operations. Last year, three 
                        employees filed safety complaints with OSHA, though the company denied 
                        any wrongdoing.

                        Former employee Dr. Curtis Connors, who left the company in 2023, has 
                        been vocal about what he calls "reckless experimentation" at Oscorp. 
                        "I warned them something like this could happen," Connors said in a 
                        phone interview this morning.

                        Federal investigators from the ATF and FBI are expected to arrive today 
                        to join local authorities in determining the cause of the explosion. The

                        Oscorp's stock plummeted 35% in pre-market trading, and analysts predict 
                        the company faces billions in liability claims. Several law firms have 
                        already announced class-action lawsuits on behalf of victims.
